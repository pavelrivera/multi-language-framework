== Description ==

Handles creation of multilingual content.

** Plugin is under development. Please be patient. **

== Installation ==

1. Download the package
2. Upload to the plugins folder
3. Activate it

== FAQ ==

1. I have placed some widgets in the sidebar but they wont show up!

All the options you set in the admin are language-independent. So you can have a different set of wigets for each language of your site. If you want a widget to allways appear you have to edit the widgets settings for all the languages.

== Known Issues ==

Will not work with Post types with a name bigger than 15 chars
